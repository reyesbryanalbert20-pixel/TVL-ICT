                    <p>
                    Pedro Evangelista Llamas was born in Pagsanjan, Laguna on August 01, 1884. Both of his parents, Gabriel Llamas and Eleutera Evangelista were born and raised in the same town too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    He studied in St. Joseph Catholic School in Hongkong for two years and continued his education in the United States where he received his Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from the University of Michigan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    At the young age of 28, he married Josefa Gomez Francia on August 26, 1912 and was blessed with nine children: Herminio, Guadalupe, Fidel, Amor, Luis, Jose, Mario, Carlos, and Eva.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    At 32, he was elected Municipal President of Pagsanjan for four years (1916–1920). He declined to be re-elected due to health problems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In 1923, he founded the Pagsanjan Academy. Later, Laguna Institute was established in 1930 to provide secondary education.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Laguna Institute flourished despite World War II, temporarily closing in 1945 and reopening in 1950.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Don Pedro Llamas died January 13, 1946 at age 61. His legacy continues through his dedication to providing quality education.
